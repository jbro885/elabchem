# STOP !!!

This code is outdated and is only preserved here for archive purposes. Many of the functions of elabchem are now present in the parent projbect, [eLabFTW](http://www.elabftw.net). 

The base eLabFTW code has undergone several years of development since eLabChem was created as a fork. None of the eLabFTW changes have been incorporated into eLabChem, meaning that eLabChem is dangerously out-of-date. Therefore you should not, typically, use eLabChem.
